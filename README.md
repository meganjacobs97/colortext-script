# Color Text Script 

## A script that produces an HTML file with colored text based on an input text file. Built with JavaScript. 

I built this script because I wanted to automatically color a large amount of text by attaching a prefix to each line. For example, I want the line `GREEN: This is green.` to be converted to HTML `This is green.`, formatted as green text. 

## Installation 

To modify the code to suit your purposes, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

To change the text to color, modify the file called `data.txt` at the root directory. This text file should contain the lines of text you want to color.

To change the prefixes and the corresponding colors, modify the file called `hexRefs.js`. 

## Usage 

To run the application on your local machine, you can run `node index.js` from the command line.
